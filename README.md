# Reinforcement Learning for Shape Slotter
@Author: Shuai wang, Ninghui Jin, Jiaqi Xin  
This project is to train a robotic arm using Doule Deep Q-Network in reinforcement learning. Its goal is to perform shape determination. The robotic arm in the simulation environment will look for the corresponding grid according to different shapes. For example, if it finds a star-shaped object, it will find the corresponding slot and put the object into the slot.
